<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Present Perfect Tense lesson-31</h2>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color"><strong>Unspecified time before the present time.</strong><br>We use the Present Perfect to say that an action happened at an unspecified time before now. The Present Perfect cannot be used with time expressions that indicate a specific time; yesterday, a year ago, when I was younger, etc. We can use the Present Perfect with; ever, never, already, yet, etc.</p>



<ul class="has-black-color has-text-color"><li>I have traveled to England many times.</li><li>Have you read the book yet?</li><li>We have met before.</li></ul>



<h3 class="has-black-color has-text-color wp-block-heading">Here are some topics that use the Present Perfect:</h3>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color"><strong>Experience</strong><br>Use the Present Perfect to talk about experience: (remember the Present Perfect cannot be used with a specific event)</p>



<ul class="has-black-color has-text-color"><li>I have been to Germany. (in my life)</li><li>I have never been to France.</li><li>I have never been skiing.</li><li>I have studied English for several years now.</li></ul>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color"><strong>Change over time</strong><br>Hence, the Present Perfect can express change over time:</p>



<ul class="has-black-color has-text-color"><li>You&#8217;ve changed since I saw you last.</li><li>He has become more concerned about his social status.</li><li>Travel has turned into a huge industry in the last few decades.</li></ul>

<ul class="has-black-color has-text-color"><li>Science has advanced in leaps and bounds.</li><li>Man has accomplished great things.</li><li>He has done well in finance.</li></ul>

<ul class="has-black-color has-text-color"><li>I have not yet finished the report.</li><li>The rain hasn&#8217;t stopped.</li><li>They haven&#8217;t yet arrived.</li></ul>



<h2 class="has-black-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>Several actions</strong></h2>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">Therefore the Present Perfect can refer to several actions which have occurred at different times in the past but it suggests that the process is incomplete.</p>



<ul class="has-black-color has-text-color"><li>We have had three power cuts this week.</li><li>The team has experienced several setbacks so far.</li><li>John has sat for three tests this month.</li></ul>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color"><strong>Time expressions</strong></p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">Sometimes we want to limit the time we are looking at when we talk about experiences. This is done by using certain time expressions:</p>



<ul class="has-black-color has-text-color"><li>Have you been abroad this year?</li><li>I have read three books by the same author in the last month.</li><li>Peter has worked for three different companies since he graduated two years ago.</li></ul>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color"><strong>From the past until now</strong></p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">We show that something has started in the past and has continued up until now with non-continuous verbs by using the Present Perfect. Phrases that show duration can be used; for three weeks, since Monday, for fifteen minutes, etc.</p>



<ul class="has-black-color has-text-color"><li>I have had a cold for two weeks.</li><li>He has been here for six months.</li><li>I have waited for too long.</li></ul>



<h2 class="has-black-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>Position of adverbs</strong></h2>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">The position of adverbs such as; always, never, only, still, just, etc. are placed after the auxiliary verb and before the past participle:</p>



<ul class="has-black-color has-text-color"><li>I&#8217;ve just seen Sarah.</li><li>I have only spoken to her over the phone.</li></ul>
