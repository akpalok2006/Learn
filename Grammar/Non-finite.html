<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In this article we will learn about &#8220;infinitive&#8221;</strong></h3>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">It is significant to understand the definition and purpose of <strong>non-finite verbs</strong>. Since the verb parts have already been discussed . Hence today we will learn <strong>non-finite verbs</strong>. There are kinds of <strong>non-finite verbs</strong> as shown in the below graph. So each one will be discussed individually for a better understanding.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What is infinitive?</h3>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color"><strong>Infinitive</strong>:-It appears or looks like a verb, so it is a verb but it doesn&#8217;t act like a verb. And infinitive always appears with &#8220;to&#8221;, like <strong>to go</strong>, <strong>to eat</strong>, <strong>to sleep</strong>, <strong>to run, </strong>and so on. This always remains in the base form. So it doesn&#8217;t change its form where<strong> </strong>the<strong> </strong>real verb changes its form according to the number and person. To understand it better look at the below examples.</p>

<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">So In the first sentence, the verb &#8220;go&#8221; becomes &#8220;goes&#8221; in the second sentence. Because it is obvious that the verb &#8220;go&#8221; is acting as per the number and persons. With the second person singular number &#8220;you&#8221; the verb &#8220;go&#8221; is in its base form. But with the third person singular number &#8220;he&#8221; verb &#8220;goes&#8221; is in its verb form five (go, went, gone, going, goes).</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">On the other side, the verb &#8220;buy&#8221; (to buy) remains in the same base form irrespective of number or person. So it is clear that infinitive never changes its form according to the number or person. Since its easy to identify the real verb because it stays close to the subject, the infinitive is always far from the subject. Infinitive always remains like a phrasal verb with &#8220;to&#8221;.</p>
