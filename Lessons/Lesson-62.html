<p><strong>Rules : Had better+Vb1</strong> (Lesson-62)</p>



<p>We use had better to refer to the present or the future, to talk about actions we think people should do or which are desirable in a specific situation. The verb form is always had, not have. We normally shorten it to ’d better in informal situations. It is followed by the infinitive without to: </p>



<p>It’s five o’clock. I’d better go now before the traffic gets too bad.</p>



<p>Not: <s>I’d better to go now.</s></p>
