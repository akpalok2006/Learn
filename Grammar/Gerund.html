<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is gerund?</span></h3>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">A gerund is a form of a verb that appears as a verb form-4 (ing). But it doesn&#8217;t act as a verb. Gerund takes the place of a subject or an object in a sentence. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">So it is called that if a verb form-4 (ing) plays a role as a subject or an object is called a gerund.</span></p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color"><strong>It can be understand by some examples:</strong></p>



<ul class="has-black-color has-text-color"><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Walking</span> is good exercise.</li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Writing</span> is my passion.</li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sleeping</span> is his habit.</li><li>I must practice <span style="text-decoration: underline;">reading.</span></li><li>You should get rid of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">smoking.</span></li><li>He likes <span style="text-decoration: underline;">running.</span></li></ul>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">In the above sentence verb form-4 (ing) (walking, writing, and sleeping) has taken position as a subject. And reading, smoking, and running as an object.</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">Those all world looks like as a verb, but they are acting as a subject and an object. Hence it is called a gerund.</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">Notice that one can only identify the parts of speech by their position and behavior. Verb form-ing comes in different parts of speech. In detail, I have composed the role of the -ing form. Since it comes in three forms (Gerund, main verb, and present participle).</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">I have tried to explain in detail but in a simple way. I appreciate your feedback.</p>



<p>Must read these important topics.</p>
