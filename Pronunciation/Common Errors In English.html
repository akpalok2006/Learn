<h3 class="wp-block-heading">To achieve perfection one must learn about the common errors.</h3>



<img src="Common errors.jpeg" alt="Commom Errors" width="50%" height="70%">


<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">Now pay attention, because what Iâ€™m about to say is really important. In day to day usage, we are used to making common errors in English. That is remarkable to the known person. But we do not figure it out. Today I am going to reveal such common errors with their correct usage.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>Incorrect</td><td>Correct</td></tr><tr><td>He gave me good <strong>advices</strong></td><td>He gave me good <strong>advice</strong></td></tr><tr><td>He gave me many <strong>advices.</strong></td><td>He gave me lots of advice. / He gave me many pieces of <strong>advice</strong>.</td></tr><tr><td>I sold my <strong>furnitures</strong>.</td><td>I sold my <strong>furniture</strong>.</td></tr><tr><td>He bought some <strong>furnitures.</strong></td><td>He bout some furniture. / He bought some pieces of <strong>furniture.</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption><strong>Note:- Advice, Furniture, and information are uncountable nouns. We can not pluralize these all. And we should not use a/an article before it.</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">That is to say, in the above table, the mistake is only about the word countable and uncountable. Thus, it is a simple mistake if one has no knowledge. But, it is an blunder mistakes for others.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td class="has-text-align-left" data-align="left"><strong>Incorrect</strong></td><td><strong>Correct</strong></td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-left" data-align="left">Our children need some <strong>educations</strong>.</td><td>Our children need some <strong>education</strong>.</td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-left" data-align="left">I need some new <strong>equipments.</strong></td><td>I need some new <strong>equipment</strong>.</td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-left" data-align="left">I took some <strong>foods</strong> to eat.</td><td>I took some <strong>food</strong> to eat.</td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-left" data-align="left">I need some <strong>cardboards</strong>.</td><td>I need some <strong>cardboard.</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption><strong>Note:- Education, equipment, food,</strong> and <strong>cardboard</strong> are uncountable nouns. For food,<strong> we can use a lot of food.</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">Above all, the bold words are uncountable. So, In our routine life or while at the office. We have to communicate with others. However, many of us are not aware of countable and uncountable. Thus, these common errors in English are spontaneous.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table alignleft is-style-regular"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Incorrect</strong></td><td><strong>Correct</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Did you buy <strong>fruits</strong> today?</td><td>Did you buy <strong>fruit</strong> today?</td></tr><tr><td>Th <strong>news</strong> are bad today</td><td>The <strong>new</strong> is bad today/ I heard some bad pieces of news today</td></tr><tr><td>Two <strong>peoples</strong> were in the garden.</td><td>Two <strong>people</strong> were in the garden.</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption><strong>Note:- Fruit (meaning banana, apples, etc) is often uncountable. In other words, Fruits mean reward (Enjoy the fruits of your hard work). So, News is a singular and uncountable noun.<br>People are already plural we should not add -s. But, when it implies for &#8220;nation&#8221;. it is considered as a singular, and then we can make it plural by adding -s. Like the peoples (=nations) of India.</strong></figcaption></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">These takes are spontaneous.</h3>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">Thus, it is obvious that we are committing mistakes. But, it&#8217;s not deliberate. It does not matter, it is deliberate or not. But, it definitely diminishes your credibility of the reader.   </p>
