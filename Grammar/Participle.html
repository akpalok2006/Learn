<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is participle</h2>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">In short, A form of a verb, often ending in &#8220;-ed&#8221; or &#8220;-ing&#8221; and comes with auxiliary verbs to make verb tenses or to form adjectives. Therefore, in this article, we will learn about the non-finite verb, participle. To clarify, It is a series of verb, where we have learned.</p>



<ul><li>What is a Verb?</li><li>Non-finite verb-infinitive: </li><li>Gerund verb.</li></ul>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">So, taking this series further, today we will learn about participle.</p>


<img src="Non-finite-1.png" alt="Non-finite" width="20%" height="30%">


<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Present participle.</h4>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">Therefore, Putting a very precise definition to make it easy. It is a verb form 4 (-ing) that acts as an adjective. The verb form -ing also comes in other different roles. Those all roles I have already discussed in detail on verb topic. So, here we will learn about the verb form 4 (-ing). That appears as an adjective.</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">For example,</p>



<ol style="color:#000000"><li>You should not disturb a <strong>sleeping</strong> cat.</li><li>There is an <strong>amusing</strong> story in this book.</li><li>The kettle is full of <strong>boiling</strong> milk.</li></ol>



<p>Above all, the words <strong>sleeping, amusing,</strong> and <strong>boiling</strong> appeared before a noun. So, these words are saying something about a noun. These words are playing a role as an adjective. Hence it is called the present participle.</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">For example,</p>



<ol style="color:#000000"><li>This is an <strong>interesting</strong> book.</li><li>It was a <strong>terrifying</strong> story.</li><li>The <strong>setting</strong> sun view was spectacular.</li><li>The <strong>chattering</strong> monkey ran away.</li><li>The <strong>melting</strong> snow made the roads slushy.</li></ol>



<div class="wp-block-coblocks-accordion">
<div class="wp-block-coblocks-accordion-item"><details><summary class="wp-block-coblocks-accordion-item__title has-background has-white-background-color">Remarks:- If helping &#8220;be&#8221; verb (is, am, are, was, were) comes before the verb form -ing. The -ing form identity is a continuous or main verb. If the verb form -ing comes in place of a noun (subject or object). It becomes gerund.</summary><div class="wp-block-coblocks-accordion-item__content" style="border-color:#ffffff">

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Past participle.</h4>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">As present participle -ing form appears as a gerund, continuous, and participle &#8220;adjective&#8221;. Likewise, the past participle verb form -3 comprises two structures. When it comes after helping verb, it forms perfect tense. But when it appears before a noun. It is called past participle &#8220;<strong>adjective</strong>&#8220;. So, in all the formation, we learned that the identity (parts of speech) of a word we can only decide as per the position of the words.</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">For some example, to know it the best.</p>



<ol style="color:#000000"><li>The <strong>injured</strong> boy was taken to the hospital.</li><li>The <strong>lost</strong> treasure was discovered.</li><li>The <strong>fallen</strong> leaves were blown away by the storm.</li></ol>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">So, here the word verb form -3 <strong>injured, lost,</strong> and <strong>fallen</strong> has appeared before a noun. Meanwhile, these all words are in the role of an adjective. So these all are the past participle &#8220;<strong>adjective</strong>&#8220;.</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">For some example,</p>



<ol style="color:#000000"><li>They are <strong>married</strong> couples.</li><li>The company is hiring <strong>experienced</strong> employees.</li><li>I met with a <strong>sad</strong> boy.</li><li>We are waiting for the <strong>predicted</strong> weather.</li><li>He wears <strong>ironed</strong> clothes.</li></ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Perfect participle.</h2>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">Therefore, adding the word &#8220;having&#8221; with past participle &#8220;verb form-3&#8221;. The perfect participle is formed. So, It says about a complete action. When a person does two works, and the second work starts after completion of the first work. To form that structure we use perfect participle.</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">For some example, to know it the best.</p>



<ol style="color:#000000"><li><strong>Having reached</strong> home I ate food.</li><li><strong>Having finished</strong> the report he informed his manager.</li><li>He took a bath Having cooked food.</li></ol>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">So, the verb form -3 added with having, <strong>having reached, having finished, and having cooked.</strong> Thus, these all are perfect participles.</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">That is to say, after composing this participle lesson, the non-finite series is completed. Thus, in the next topic, we will learn the most significant part of the verb, finite verb. </p>
