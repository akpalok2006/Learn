<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">So in the above sentences, going, playing, watching, sleeping, and waiting are verbs.</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color"><strong>Role-2: </strong>As a gerund (non-finite), when a verb form-4 is used as a subject or an object. It is called a<strong> </strong>gerund. Like:</p>

<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">In the above sentences, walking, dancing, smoking, writing, and reading are gerund.</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">Role-3: As an adjective also called present participle (non-finite), when verb form-4 is used as an adjective in a sentence. It is called a present participle. Like:</p>



<ul class="has-black-color has-text-color"><li>I saw a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">playing</span> boy.</li><li>I read a piece of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">interesting </span>news.</li><li>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">barking</span> dog was calm today.</li><li>It was a very <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tiring</span> day at the workplace.</li></ul>
