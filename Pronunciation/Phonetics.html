<p>Let&#8217;s learn how to pronounce this sound the right (American) way. OK, to pronounce the /æ/ sound, you should focus on the correct position of your tongue and jaw. Open your mouth as wide as possible, slightly spread your lips, and tense them. Tense your tongue, flatten it, and push it forward. Your tongue should be positioned very low in your mouth. </p>

<img src="dʒ.png" alt="dʒ sound" width="50%" height="70%">




<p>Remember, the /dʒ/ is an affricate sound, so it&#8217;s important to completely stop the air in your mouth and then immediately release it with friction. Now, let&#8217;s try and merge the /d/ and the /ʒ/ sounds together: /dʒ/, /dʒ/, /dʒ/. </p>



<p>Here are a few typical mistakes that people make when pronouncing this sound. 1. The most common problem is that non-native English speakers devoice the /dʒ/ consonant, especially when it occurs at the end of words. Often, people don&#8217;t realize that they pronounce the voiceless /tʃ/ sound instead. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sound Consonant (Phonetics Sound)</h2>

<img src="ʒ.png" alt="ʒ sound" width="50%" height="70%">




<p>As usual, let&#8217;s begin with some phonology. Stay calm, it&#8217;s not complicated :). The /ʒ/ belongs to a category of consonant sounds called the fricatives. This is the largest group of consonants in American English: it consists of nine different sounds! </p>



<p>So, why are they called fricative consonants? All these sounds are made by partially blocking the air moving through your mouth, which creates audible friction. Speaking about the /ʒ/ consonant, &#8211; this sound is made by partially blocking the air flowing between the blade of your tongue and the roof of your mouth. The /ʒ/ sound is incredibly rare. It&#8217;s present in less than 1% of English words. </p>
