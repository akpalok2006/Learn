<p><strong>Model passive voice</strong></p>



<p>As we used the rules to convert the tenses into the passive voice. Similarly, the model verb will follow the rules.</p>



<p>To convert the simple model into the passive voice, we add the verb &#8220;be&#8221; and past participle.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Active</strong></td><td><strong>Passive</strong></td></tr><tr><td>The government <strong>should</strong> mitigate the crime</td><td>The crime <strong>should be</strong> mitigated by the government</td></tr><tr><td>We <strong>should not</strong> consume the alcohol</td><td>The alcohol <strong>should not be</strong> consumed by us</td></tr><tr><td>Should the children use the phone?</td><td>Should the phone be used by the children?</td></tr><tr><td>Why should the children not use the phone?</td><td>Why the phone should not be used by the children?</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p> <strong>In passive voice, a subject may or may not be present.</strong> </p>



<ol><li>The rules should be followed strictly.</li><li>The report should be submitted on time.</li><li>The use of Pesticides should be banned from eatables.</li><li>The flight fare should be reduced.</li><li>The road should be repaired.</li><li>A meeting invite should be sent each month.</li></ol>



<p>The same rules apply to the remaining models (can, may, might, could, ought to,</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The passive voice of should have and could have.</h2>



<p>Subject + should/could have + past participle.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>Active </td><td>Passive</td></tr><tr><td>The engineer should have resolved this glitch</td><td>This glitch should have been resolved by the engineer.</td></tr><tr><td> The engineer could have resolved this glitch </td><td> This glitch could have been resolved by the engineer. </td></tr><tr><td>The management should have informed the employees</td><td>The employees should have been informed by the management</td></tr><tr><td> The management could have informed the employees </td><td> The employees could have been informed by the management </td></tr><tr><td>Police should not arrest innocent people.</td><td>Innocent people should not have been arrested by the police.</td></tr><tr><td>Why could the government have not allowed the vaccine free of cost?</td><td>Why the vaccine could not have been allowed by the government free of cost?</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Henceforth, we learned that after the helping verb &#8220;has/have&#8221;, we used been and verb past participle form. Similarly, after the simple model helping verb, we use &#8220;be&#8221; and verb past participle form.</p>
