<h2 class="has-black-color has-text-color wp-block-heading">Let&#8217;s render point number 1, &#8220;<strong style="font-size: revert; color: initial;">In Passive voice, the Subject may or may not be present&#8221;.</strong><span style="font-size: revert; color: initial;"> </span></h2>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color"> In English grammar, we use the word &#8216;<strong>subject</strong>&#8216; to talk about the person or thing (a noun or pronoun) that does the &#8216;action. So, the subject of a sentence is the person, place, thing, or idea that is performing the action.</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">Examples of subjects in the English language<br>Simple sentences<br>Very simple sentences in English have one verb and one subject. For example:</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color"><strong>John works</strong>. Here, the subject is “<strong>John</strong>.” The verb is “works.” In this example, John is the subject, because he is the person doing the action, “working” in this case.</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color"><br><strong>Alexander sleeps.</strong> <strong> <strong>Alexander </strong></strong>is the subject because he’s doing the action of “sleeping”.</p>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color"><br>The subject doesn’t always have to be a <strong>person/name</strong>. Very often it is not, but it is a pronoun (for example, <strong>he/she/it</strong>, etc.), or a group of people (<strong>we/they</strong>). Have a look at the following sentences.</p>



<ol class="has-black-color has-text-color"><li>I sleep. (The subject is ‘<strong>I</strong>’ because it’s doing the action of sleeping.)</li><li>We are watching Netflix. (The subject is ‘<strong>we</strong>’ because it’s doing the action of watching)</li><li>They play football. (The subject is ‘<strong>they</strong>’ because it’s doing the action of playing)</li></ol>



<h2 class="has-black-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"> Let&#8217;s render point number 2, &#8220;<strong>We can never make passive voice without a direct Object</strong>&#8220;. </h2>



<p class="has-black-color has-text-color">As we know in parts of speech, <strong>nouns and pronouns</strong> have characteristics to appear as a <strong>subject and object</strong>. Whereas, <strong>verbs and prepositions</strong> have features to take an <strong>object</strong>. Hence, let&#8217;s shed a light on the <strong>direct and indirect objects</strong>. In English grammar terms, a transitive and intransitive verb is used either.
